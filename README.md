Bonus : As I am quite experienced in web and mobile apps, I was focused on creating a beautiful website and respecting the rules of UI and UX to ensure a good fluidity while navigating the site. I added the metadata and microdata (#1 add-on) and I also added a video on the landing page and a way to import pictures and videos when listing your own property (#2 add-on).
Even though I used a librairy for the latter, I obviously know how to do it but again it takes so much time to do I would not have had time for other parts of the site.
I think I deserve a bonus for the design and the fluidity of the site (UX / UI) even though due to the limited time I had, some pages are missing or not finished at all.
I also deserve a bonus for the files import and the video in the background.
Also, I added @media queries on the landing page only but again, with the dynamic header I ran into troubles and spend quite a time figuring out the problem but I submit it with some issues. That will be fixed next time.
The responsive on the search and single item page will be painful to do so I guess I will deserve something for the difficulty next time?

Don't worry, you'll have the most beautiful website you've ever seen at the end of this project :)


**PS : **

I did comment a lot of things because of the amount of content I have, and one of the TAs told me it was ok.
Also, some constraints in the assessment criterias on Avenue were not good at all for UX purposes so I didn't follow them.
Don't forget to click on "CLICK ME" or the thumbnails in the searchpage to access the single item page sample.



Framework : ReactJS
I decided to use ReactJS because I previously developed mobile applications using React Native and I fell in love with this framework because it's fast and easy to manage.
I am working with different librairies that you can find in package.json. These are mostly used for design, such as @material-ui and @flag-icon. I am using these because they allow me to create beautiful inputs and components in a short amount of time, and I can access resources that would have taken me hours to do myself.

To start the files on your own computer from github, you need to install nodeJs, clone the project and follow the instructions below (written automatically by React when creating a new web app).




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
